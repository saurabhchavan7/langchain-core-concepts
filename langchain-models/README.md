# LangChain LLM Practical Work

This repository contains practical work with LangChain while building a strong understanding of large language model based systems.

The focus is on working directly with models, understanding their behavior, and using LangChain to structure those interactions.

## Current Work

Currently working on LangChain’s Models layer.

This includes language models, chat models, and embedding models across different providers, with attention to inputs, outputs, limitations, and abstraction boundaries.

Moving forward:
- Prompt handling
- Chains and multi-step flows
- Retrieval-based systems
- Memory and conversation handling
- Agent workflows
